TODO: Need to decide how to add API key to requests:

Option 1: We create a request object:
  * Request { ApiKey: xxx, Request: yyy, RequestObjectClass: zzz }, where yyy could be a oneof(each request type), or simply a bytes version of the underlying request; and zzz would be explicit on the request object

Option 2: Each service request requires an API key explicitly:
  * QueryPositionRequest { ApiKey: xxx, <the rest of the request as is> }
  * CreateTransactionRequest { ApiKey: xxx, <the rest of the request as is> }

Option 3: ? 

Pros/Cons

* Option 1: 
  * PRO: Each indvidual request object doesn't require any change
  * PRO: Each underlying service could be sent the request and not even be aware of the security layer
  * CON: ? Adds a layer of indirection?

* Option 2: 
  * PRO: Very explicit approach
  * CON: Any changes in ApiKey model would need to be propagated to all the new objects
  * CON: Requires developers to understand they need to add this to new requests they define


I'm favoring option 1, but will think on it.
